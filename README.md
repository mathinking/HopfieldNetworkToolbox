# Hopfield Network Toolbox for MATLAB
This Hopfield Network Toolbox is mainly focused in **Continuous Hopfield Networks** (CHNs). This Toolbox is based on the work by Javier Yáñez, Pedro M. Talaván and Lucas García.

The Continuous Hopfield Network (CHN) is a **recurrent neural network** with an associated differential equation, whose state evolves from an initial condition to an equilibrium point by minimizing a Lyapunov function. 
As the Lyapunov function is associated with an objective function of the optimization problem (i.e. the mapping process), the equilibrium, or stable point, helps identify a local optimum for the optimization problem.
The dynamics of the CHN is described by a **differential equation**:

![\frac{du}{dt} = - \frac{u}{\Lambda} + T v + i^b](http://mathurl.com/hzhnzj5.png) 

and the output function is a hyperbolic tangent:

![v_i = g(u_i) = \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 + \tanh \left( \frac{u_i}{u_0} \right) \right), \qquad u_0 > 0](http://mathurl.com/zdeg52h.png)

The existence of an equilibrium point is guaranteed if a Lyapunov or energy function exists. The idea is that the network's Lyapunov function, when ![\Lambda \rightarrow{} \infty](http://mathurl.com/hl2t4by.png), is associated with the cost function to be minimized in the combinatorial problem.

The CHN will solve those combinatorial problems which can be expressed as the constrained minimization of: 

![E(v) = -  \frac{1}{2} v^t T v - (i^b)^t v](http://mathurl.com/goa77to.png)

However, at this point the Hopfield Network Toolbox is primarily designed to solve the Traveling Salesman Proble,.

## Download 
It is recommended to use the [latest release](https://github.com/mathinking/HopfieldNetworkToolbox/releases/latest). You may download the entire source code or a single installable Toolbox file.

## Install
If you have downloaded the source code, simply run
```sh
>> setup_hopfieldNetwork
```
in MATLAB's Command Window to add all the right paths.

If you have downloaded the `.mltbx` file, double click it from within MATLAB to install the Toolbox.
