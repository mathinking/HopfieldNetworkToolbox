%% What is a HopfieldNetwork?
% |HopfieldNetwork| is a MATLAB class that has been developed to solve the 
% Continuous Hopfield Network using MATLAB. 
% 
% |HopfieldNetwork| has been programmed in a similiar way to other Artificial 
% Neural Networks available in Neural Network Toolbox™, using |classdef| 
% to create and design the class.
% 
% |HopfieldNetwork| is a generic class which can be used to solve any kind of
% combinatorial optimization problem. 
%
% The child classes |HopfieldNetworkGQKP| and |HopfieldNetworkTSP| derive 
% from |HopfieldNetwork|, with special focus in solving the Generalized 
% Quadratic Knapsack Problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem, using 
% Continuous Hopfield Networks.
