%% How to solve improve the performance of the Hopfield Network for the TSP
% As it probably has already been noted in previous sections, the solutions
% of the Hopfield Network cannot compete against other popular
% combinatorial optimization methods. However, there are several ways in
% which we can considerably improve the solution obtain through Hopfield
% Networks. 
% The following sections highlight 2 crucial aspects worth considering: the 
% parameter C and the initial point for the simulation.
