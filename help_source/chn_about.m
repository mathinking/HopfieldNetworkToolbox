%% What problems can Hopfield Network Toolbox solve?
%
% Hopfield Networks may solve any combinatorial optimization problem, given
% it is properly mapped to the network. However, at this point, Hopfield
% Network Toolbox is mainly designed to solve The Traveling Salesman
% Problem. 
% 
% The Toolbox has been designed though to be easily expanded to solve any
% combinatorial optimization problem.
