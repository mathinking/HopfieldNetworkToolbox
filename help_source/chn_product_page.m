%% Hopfield Network Toolbox
% The *Hopfield Network Toolbox* can solve combinatorial optimization
% problems by using Hopfield Neural Networks. The Hopfield Network Toolbox 
% is focused in Continuous Hopfield Networks. 
%
% If you are interested in using Discrete Hopfield Networks, see the
% documentation for

% newhop>| in <http://www.mathworks.com/products/neural-network/ Neural 
% Network Toolbox™>.
%
% The Continuous Hopfield Network (CHN) is a recurrent neural network with 
% an associated differential equation, whose state evolves from an initial 
% condition to an equilibrium point by minimizing a Lyapunov function. As 
% the Lyapunov function is associated with an objective function of the 
% optimization problem (i.e. the mapping process), the equilibrium, or 
% stable point, helps identify a local optimum for the optimization 
% problem.
