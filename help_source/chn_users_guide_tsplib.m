%% TSPLIB - A library for Traveling Salesman Problems
% <http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/comopt/software/TSPLIB95/ 
% TSPLIB> is a collection of Traveling Salesman Problem instances of  
% varying difficulty published by Gerhard Reinelt in 1991, which has been 
% extensively used by many research groups for comparing results.
% 
% The library has already been installed with the Hopfield Network Toolbox. 
% If for some reason you need to download the TSPLIB library again, use the
% following script to do so (since some TSPLIB instances are not correctly
% formated and required some additional parsing).
