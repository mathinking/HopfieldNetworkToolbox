%% Hopfield Network TSP Solver App
% The Hopfield Network TSP Solver App allows to solve the Traveling
% Salesman Problem using Continuous Hopfield Networks by using different
% architectures or schemes: |classic|, |classic&2opt|, |divide-conquer|, 
% and |divide-conquer&2opt|. The solver algorithms available include 
% |euler|, |runge-kutta| and |talavan-yanez|.
% 
% You will find the Hopfield Network TSP Solver App from the APPS section
% in your MATLAB Desktop. Alternatively, you can open the app calling the
% function |hopfieldNetworkTSPApp|.

% The Hopfield Network TSP Solver App can solve TSPLIB problems, TSPs where
% its cities are located at the vertices of regular polygons, and any TSP
% problem defined by its coordinates or distance matrix.
