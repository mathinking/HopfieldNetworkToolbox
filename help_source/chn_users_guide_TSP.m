%% How to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem using Hopfield Networks 
%
% The Continuous Hopfield Network has been extensively used to solve the 
% Travelling Salesman Problem. However, only after Talaván and Yáñez's 
% approach with an appropriate problem parametrization, it is reasonable to
% solve the TSP using a Hopfield Network, as obtaining a feasible solution
% is guaranteed. 
% 
% The Hopfield Network |HopfieldNetworkTSP| can solve the following types 
% of problems:
%
% * <Example_tspUsingRegularPolygons.html Using regular Polygons>
% * <Example_tspUsingTSPLIB.html Using TSPLIB problems>
% * <Example_tspUsingCoords.html Providing the problem's coordinates>
% * <chn_users_guide_TSP_distance.html Providing the problem's distance 
% matrix>
